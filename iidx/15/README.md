## `default-backup-data`

Pre-generated default "backup data" for the `e:\` and `f:\` drive. The stock game crashes on boot
without any backup data present and trying to generate default backup data. This is a bug in the
stock game. Use the provided generated data which contains all default settings by the game by
copying it either to a local mount/redirect for `e:\` and `f:\` drives or to an actual volume. The
method depends on whether you use this on a stock drive or a custom setup.
